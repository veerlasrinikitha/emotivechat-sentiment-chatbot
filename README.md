# Emotivechat-sentiment-chatbot
EmotiveChat is an advanced conversational AI that combines deep learning and sentiment analysis to deliver emotionally intelligent and context-aware responses. It utilizes a hybrid neural network architecture, integrating convolutional and recurrent layers for robust emotion detection from text. Pre-processing steps like tokenization and lemmatization enhance input quality for accurate classification. Detected emotions and sentiments directly guide the chatbotâ€™s response generation, ensuring empathetic and relevant replies. This methodology enables EmotiveChat to provide natural, engaging, and emotionally adaptive user interactions.
# Features
- Emotion Detection: Uses a BERT-based classifier to recognize 28 fine-grained emotions and map them to broader sentiment categories (positive, negative, ambiguous, neutral).
- Sentiment-Aware Responses: Generates chatbot replies tailored to the detected emotion group.
- Interactive UI: Demo interface using IPython widgets for conversational testing.
-Evaluation Tools: Includes scripts for NLP and HCI evaluation, with metrics and visualizations.
